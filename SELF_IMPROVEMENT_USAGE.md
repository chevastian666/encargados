# Self-Improvement Protocol - Usage Guide

## Quick Start

The self-improvement protocol has been successfully integrated into the codebase. Here's how to use it:

### 1. View the Self-Improvement Dashboard

To see the self-improvement system in action, add the dashboard to your app:

```javascript
import { SelfImprovementDashboard } from './components/views';

// In your app component
<SelfImprovementDashboard />
```

### 2. Use in Your Components

There are two example implementations you can reference:

#### Basic Integration Example
See `src/components/views/DashboardWithSelfImprovement.jsx` for a complete example of how to integrate self-improvement into a component.

#### Using the Hook
```javascript
import { useSelfImprovement } from './hooks/useSelfImprovement';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const selfImprove = useSelfImprovement('MyComponent');
  
  // Handle errors automatically
  try {
    // Your code
  } catch (error) {
    await selfImprove.handleError(error);
  }
};
```

### 3. Current Status

All self-improvement components have been:
- ✅ Created and implemented
- ✅ Import/export paths fixed
- ✅ CSS classes adjusted for Tailwind compatibility
- ✅ Integration examples provided
- ✅ Documentation created

### 4. Key Features Working

- **Automatic Error Recovery**: Errors are automatically diagnosed and fixed when possible
- **Tool Discovery**: Missing tools are discovered and integrated automatically
- **Self-Healing Patterns**: Circuit breakers, auto-retry, fallbacks, and cache recovery
- **Test Generation**: Regression tests are generated from real failures
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Dashboard shows system health and improvements

### 5. Files Created

- `/src/utils/selfImprovement.js` - Core self-improvement engine
- `/src/services/mcpIntegration.service.js` - MCP integration with self-healing
- `/src/utils/testRunner.js` - Automated test runner
- `/src/hooks/useSelfImprovement.js` - React hook for easy integration
- `/src/components/views/SelfImprovementDashboard.jsx` - Monitoring dashboard
- `/src/components/views/DashboardWithSelfImprovement.jsx` - Example implementation

### 6. No External Dependencies

The system uses only the existing React setup and doesn't require any additional packages.

## Testing the System

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. The self-improvement system will automatically:
   - Monitor for errors
   - Attempt to fix issues
   - Generate tests from failures
   - Apply healing patterns

3. View the dashboard to see:
   - Total failures and fixes
   - Registered tools
   - Test results
   - MCP health status

## Next Steps

1. Integrate the `useSelfImprovement` hook into components that need error resilience
2. Monitor the dashboard during development to track improvements
3. Export reports periodically to analyze patterns
4. Customize self-healing patterns for your specific use cases
